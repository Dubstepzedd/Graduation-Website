# <ins>Graduation Website</ins>

## <ins>Description</ins>
This is a project that I developed for a highschool graduation. It is used as a 
common platform for all who are invited. It contains necessary information and a wishlist. 
All photos and information have been replaced with placeholders due to privacy. 

The website was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP and a tiny bit of Javascript. PHP was mainly used for the backend, while
HTML and CSS - of course - was used for the frontend. The requirement, design, development and deployment phases of this
project took combined about 3 months. 

## <ins>How can I test the page?</ins>
[NOTE: Has only been tested on Windows 10/11]
In order to test the page for free, the best way is to download software such as <b>MAMP</b> from their
official [website](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/). When installed, follow these simple steps:

### Setup root folder
Open MAMP and click on <b>MAMP->Preferences->Server</b>. Here you can choose the documentation root, which has to be the cloned project in order to work.
Press "OK".
### Setup SQL-database
When the root folder has been set, click on <b>"Start Server"</b> and wait for it to turn on (indicated by lights).
When the server is on, click on <b>"Open WebStart page"</b>. On the page you'll have to scroll down a bit until you see the header
<b>"MySQL"</b>. Click on the link with the label  <b>"phpMyAdmin"</b>. You now need to create a database called <b>"examination"</b> with 3 tables.
1. A table called  <b>"gift"</b>. It has the columns: "id", "name", "taken" "guest_id" that are of type int, varchar(100), bit(1) and int.
2. A table called  <b>"guest"</b>. It has the columns: "id", "firstName", "lastName", "email", "pass", "admin" that are of type int, varchar(50), varchar(50), varchar(50), char(60) and bit(1).
3. A table called  <b>"link"</b>. It has the columns "id", "address_key" with that are of type int and varchar(20).

## <ins>Improvements to be made</ins>
There are a lot of improvements that can be made. 
1. First of all, PHP is old and insecure. A change of programming language for the backend would be a good start. 
2. Security is something that I tried keeping in mind while developing the website, however there might still be some 
security flaws in the project. 
3. The project is not as modular as I would like it to be. There are a lot of files and it gets confusing fast.
4. Keep passwords, keys and other sensitive information in a separate git ignored file. I had to remove all this information before pushing it onto github.
